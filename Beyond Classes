Beyond Classes Chapter covers the following objectives:

Using Object-Oriented Concepts in Java

- Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain teh object life-cycle including creation, reassigning references and garbage collection

- Create classes and records, and define and use instance and static field and methods, ocnstuctors adn instance and static initializers

- Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation, and create immutable objects. Use local varaible type inference.

- Implement inheritance, including abstract and sealed as well as record classes. Override methods, including that of the Object Class. Implement polymorphism and differentiate between object type and reference type. Perform reference type casting,
identify object type using instanceof operator, and pattern matching with the instanceof operator and switch construct

- Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces and utilize private, static and default interface methods
- Create and use enum types with fields, methods and constructors
