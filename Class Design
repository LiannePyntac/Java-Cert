Class Design

Using Object Oriented Concepts in Java

- Create classes and records and define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors adn instance and static initializers
- Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation adn create immutable objects. Use local variable type inference

- Implement inheritance, including abstractand sealed types as well as record classes. 
- Override methods including that of the Object Class
- Implement polymorphism and differentitate between object type and reference type.
- perform reference type casting, identify object types using the instanceof operator, and pattern matching with the instanceof operator and the switch construct.
